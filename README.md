# Chillify

### Description
Chillify is a program designed to help you take care of your health.

It will remind you when it's time to take a break while working on your computer. You can customize the frequency and duration of breaks, as well as add programs/games during which it will not disturb you.

Additionally, there is a feature to pause video/audio playback during breaks for a more convenient movie-watching or music-listening experience.
